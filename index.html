<h2>About me</h2>
I was born in 2002, I dropped out of college in 2023. I was studying biology teaching at Hacettepe University. 
<br> 
I do not have joy of living, I am currently working as shopping assistant -aka sl*ve- at Migros.
<br>
I'm in debt, I made the biggest mistake in the world by buying a laptop, but it was necessary to have a laptop. 
<br> 
I wanna quit this job and wanna have meaningful things to do in this life.

<h3> My favorite sitcoms </h3>


<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <h4><li>The Good Place (4,5/5)</li></h4>
    This sitcom is my all times favorite. I really enjoyed watching it and love to bully people to watch this. 
   
    <h4><li>How I Met Your Mother (3.95/5)</li></h4>
   This one is the beginning of everything. I started watching sitcoms with this show. Would reccomend.
   
    <h4><li>Brooklyn 99 (4,45/5)</li></h4>
    I was in love with the variety of the characters. Also loved how the things work in the show. Highly recommended.
